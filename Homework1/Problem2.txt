The two's complement of a number can be determined by 2^n - N where N is the number in base 10 and n is the number of bits required to express N in base 2.

a) 10 is positive so just same as binary:
01010

b)same as part a:
0110110100

c) 1024's two's complement notation: 010000000000

For negative number's two's complement notation requires taking the one's complement of the absolute value then adding 1.

d)13 in binary is 01101 so -13's twos complement representation is 10011

e)1023 is 01111111111 in binary
so 10000000001 is -1023 in two's complement notation

f)-1024 two's complement representation is 110000000000 using the result we obtained in part c
